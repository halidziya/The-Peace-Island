# The Peace Island

  Alpha was tired of ugly politics. The human race was fighting with each other all time in all centuries. Could there be a solution? What are the reasons of the conflicts: human greed, arrogance, selfishness ... The list goes on. Is it possible to create a solution? Without having a complete answer Alpha thought creating additional resources will reduce the tension. Considering the main source of all energy on earth the sun was the very good candidate to harvest. Using abundance of sunshine, it is possible to generate tons of energy on the surface of the ocean. Creating an artificial platform and obtaining the water directly from ocean electrolysis of the water and obtaining hydrogen fuel could be a good candidate. "Could I create a new continent" he thought. 
  
  Where to start then ? Creating a new continent ? It is easy to create platform. But how to make it self sustainable ? Water , food and energy is the basic requirements. Automation is necessary for most of the part to reduce the human effort. It should be cost effective as well to scale it to continent size. But lets start from small. An open source crowd continent.

# The Peace Island

  Alpha was tired of ugly politics in 2016. The human race was fighting with each other all time in all centuries. Could there be a solution? What are the reasons of the conflicts: human greed, arrogance, selfishness ... The list goes on. Is it possible to create a solution? Without having a complete answer Alpha thought creating additional resources will reduce the tension. Considering the main source of all energy on earth the sun was the very good candidate to harvest. Using abundance of sunshine, it is possible to generate tons of energy on the surface of the ocean. Creating an artificial platform and obtaining the water directly from ocean electrolysis of the water and obtaining hydrogen fuel could be a good candidate. "Could I create a new continent" he thought. 
 
Alpha decided to act. 

 
End : Whatever the technology is the evil inside human being cannot be alleviated. There would be always conflicts here. All we hope is the justice in the afterlife.

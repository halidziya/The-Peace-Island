Alpha was tired of ugly politics. The human race was fighting with each other all time in all centuries. 

"We need to start thinking about our future," he said to his wife one evening. "The future of the human race. We can't keep living like this."

His wife, Omega, looked at him with love and understanding. She knew that her husband was a visionary and that he was always thinking about ways to make the world a better place.

"What do you want to do?" she asked him.

"I want to create a utopia," he replied. "A place where there is no war, no poverty, no crime. A place where everyone is happy and free."

Omega smiled at her husband's idealism. She knew that it was possible, but she also knew that it would be very difficult to achieve.

"It will take a lot of work," she said. "But I'm sure you can do it."

And so Alpha set out on his quest to create a utopia. He gathered together the greatest minds of his time and began to work on a plan. It was difficult, but slowly, bit by bit, they made progress. And finally, after many years of hard work, they succeeded.

The first thing they did was to eliminate all weapons.


Considering the main source of all energy on earth the sun was the very good candidate to harvest. solar panels were created and became mass-produced. Soon all the homes had them. Cars were electric too and public transportation was free. There were no traffic jams, no pollution.

The next thing they did was to create a universal basic income. This ensured that everyone had enough money to live on regardless of whether they worked or not. With no one having to worry about money, crime rates dropped dramatically.

They also implemented a education system that was free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 18. This helped to eradicate illiteracy and ignorance.

With all these changes, the world slowly began to transform into the utopia that Alpha had dreamed of. There was still some way to go, but it was a start. And finally, after centuries of conflict and misery, the human race had found peace at last.



Using abundance of sunshine, it is possible to generate tons of energy on the surface of the ocean. Creating an artificial platform and obtaining the water directly from ocean electrolysis of the water and obtaining hydrogen fuel could be a good candidate. "Could I create a new continent" he thought. If it is possible to build a new continent, it could be self-sufficient, have its own food and water, and be completely green. This would be the perfect place to start his utopia.

He gathered the smartest people in the world and started working on the project. It took many years, but they finally did it. They created a new continent, which they named Utopia.

Utopia was a perfect place; there was no crime, no poverty, no disease. Everyone was happy and free. It was everything that Alpha had dreamed of.

The only problem was that Utopia was isolated from the rest of the world. The people of Utopia had everything they needed, but they were cut off from the rest of humanity.

Alpha knew that he had to find a way to connect Utopia to the rest of the world, so that everyone could benefit from its perfection. But he also knew that it would be difficult, because the people of Utopia were content with their lives and didn't want to change anything.

But Alpha was a visionary, and he knew that anything is possible if you set your mind to it. So he set out on his quest to connect Utopia to the rest of the world, and finally, after many years of hard work, he succeeded.


 Automation is necessary for most of the part to reduce the human effort. It should be cost effective as well to scale it to continent size. But lets start from small. An open source crowd continent. "Could I create a new continent" he thought. If it is possible to build a new continent, it could be self-sufficient, have its own food and water, and be completely green. This would be the perfect place to start his utopia.

People were happy for a while. However, then the corruption started. Greed overcome 
the people of Utopia and they started to fight with each other. They forgot their utopian ways and went back to their old ways of fighting and wars.

Alpha was heartbroken. He had worked so hard to create this perfect place, and now it was ruined. He didn't know what to do.

But then he remembered that no matter how difficult something is, it is always possible if you set your mind to it. So he gathered the people of Utopia together and said, "We can build this utopia again. We just have to work together and remember what we are fighting for."

And so they did. They worked together and slowly but surely they rebuilt their perfect world. And this time, they made sure that it would never be lost again.

He used data analysis to understand the human physiology of greed. He identified the root cause and started to work on a solution. It took him many years, but he finally did it. He created a serum that would suppress the greed gene in human beings.

He injected the serum into the people of Utopia and they slowly started to change. The greed disappeared and they went back to being the happy, content people they were before.

Alpha had saved Utopia. And this time, it would never be lost again.

Until a new species comes. They were much harsh as compared to humans. 
They had no emotion, no mercy. They only wanted one thing- to dominate the entire universe. 

The utopian ways were no match for them and they soon started to take over the planet. 

Alpha knew that he had to do something, but he didn't know what. He was getting old and he knew that he wouldn't be able to fight them forever.

One point he would like to make for these aliens. Universe is so big. It has trillions of light years in space. Do not fight do science. He used science to communicate. He created some translation tool first. 

With these tools, they started to understand each other. They realized that they were not so different after all. They both wanted the same thing- a place where they could live in peace and harmony.

So they decided to work together to create a utopia that would be perfect for both of their species. And finally, after many years of hard work, they succeeded.

This time, the utopia was perfect. It was everything that Alpha and the people of Utopia had ever dreamed of. And it would never be lost again.

Until, the communication channel somehow broken unnoticing.  

The utopian ways were no match for them and they soon started to take over the planet. 

Alpha knew that he had to do something, but he didn't know what. He was getting old and he knew that he wouldn't be able to fight them forever.

He got old on all these wars. He was happy. But his life is about the end. No matter how the perfect the life is it is not eternal. 

He wanted to leave a mark. He wanted to be remembered after his death. 

He wanted to create something that would last forever.

And so he did. He created the first ever time machine.

With this time machine, he could go back in time and change the course of history. He could make sure that Utopia was never lost again.

And so he did. He went back in time and changed the course of history. Utopia was never lost again and it remains perfect forever.

Even with his time machine on the other hand. His body was signaling about his health. His wife was worried. 

She wanted him to go and take a break. They both decided to go on a vacation. 

During their vacation, they went to a lot of different places. They saw the beauty of the world and they were happy. 

But then, one day, while they were walking in the woods, they came across a group of people who were being attacked by a bear. Alpha ran to help them, but he was too late. The bear had already killed one of the men.

Alpha was devastated. He had never seen someone die before that harshly. It was something that he had always tried to avoid.

He wanted to make sure that this never happened again. So he went back in time and changed the course of history so that the bear never existed.

And so Utopia was perfect once again.

As we are never perfect, his vacation ended with an unpleasant surprise. His neck was hurting. It was then he found out he had cancer and only had a few months to live.

Omega was devastated. She didn't want to lose her husband. She loved him more than anything in the world.

But Alpha was at peace. He knew that he had done everything he could to make the world a better place. And he knew that his work would continue after he was gone.

Omega decided to use the time machine to go back in time and save her husband's life. But when she got there, she realized that she couldn't change the past. All she could do was watch as her husband died in her arms.

It was a painful experience, but it taught Omega something important. She realized that even though we can't change the past, we can learn from it and use it to make the future better.

And so she decided to use her husband's work to make the world a better place. She went back in time and used her knowledge of the future to help people in the present. And slowly but surely, she made the world a better place.

Just like her husband had always wanted.

And Utopia was perfect without Alpha again.

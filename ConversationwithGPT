Write a joke :

 
 

A lady went to a store and saw a man with a huge head.

"Excuse me, sir," she said. "I've never seen someone with a head that big. What did you do?"

"I'm a genius," he replied. "I solved a Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds."

"So what are you doing in this store ?" said the lady, "It's a grocery store."

"I'm looking for a job," he said.

She asked how come a genius like you could not find a job ?

"It's hard to find a job when you're such a genius that no one will hire you because they think you'll be too smart for the job."

So whats the problem then she said 

"I can't even get hired as a janitor because they think I'll be too smart to clean toilets."

Just play dumb.  she said

"I tried that.  I went for an interview and they asked me how long a 'light year' was.  I had no idea, so I just guessed 'nine months.'"

So what happened then she asked. 

"They told me I was hired!  But then I found out it was a pregnancy test."

Which job you have applied for ?  she asked again 

"I tried to apply for a job as an electrician, but they told me I was too bright."

But why they asked you to have pregnancy test she was confused 

"I applied for a job at an X-ray lab, but they told me I couldn't work there because I was too luminous."

Are you pregnant?  she finally asked 

"No, I'm a light bulb."

What does that even mean ? 


I don't know, but it was the only thing I could think of to say that would get me hired anywhere.

I think you are not that genius , I believe she rolled her eyes. 

It's hard to find a job when you're such a genius that no one will hire you because they think you'll be too smart for the job.

You are just repeating yourself. 

I know, but I can't think of anything else to say.

That means actually you are not genius. 

I am a genius, I solved a Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds.

So, what is it a difficult problem ? 

No, it's not difficult, but it's hard to find a job when you're such a genius that no one will hire you because they think you'll be too smart for the job.

Do you identify yourself as genius

I am a genius, I solved a Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds.

Please stop talking about Rubik's cube. I do not care she shouted. 

I'm sorry, it's just that it's hard to find a job when you're such a genius that no one will hire you because they think you'll be too smart for the job.

You are not genius!!!! And I do not care. 

I am a genius, I solved a Rubik's Cube in less than 20 seconds.

OK, I am done. Please leave me alone. Do not say anything else. 

I'm sorry, it's just that it's hard to find a job when you're such a genius that no one will hire you because they think you'll be too smart for the job.
